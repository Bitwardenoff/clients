/*
 * FireFox applies default styles to extensions, one of which is `text-align: start`.
 * This causes some elements to not inherit the `text-align` property from their parent,
 * as they would in other browser implementations.
 *
 * Apply `text-align: inherit` to all elements to ensure they inherit the `text-align` property from their parent.
 *
 * Note:
 * - The full `extension.css` that is applied can be viewed here: https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/tip/browser/components/extensions/extension.css#l8
 * - According to the documentation within the css file, this will be obsolete for MV3 extensions.
