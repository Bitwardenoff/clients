# Setup

**Requirements**

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) v8.11 or greater
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) (`npm install --global gulp-cli`)
- Chrome (preferred), Opera, or Firefox browser

## Run the app

In the first setup, run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

On posterior runs, just use the command `npm run build:watch`

## For macOS users

If for some reason your `npm install` failed due to `node-gyp`, read on.

If your Mac has been upgraded to macOS Catalina (10.15), please [read this](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/master/macOS_Catalina.md).
