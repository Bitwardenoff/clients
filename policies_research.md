|_comp8_| at least 8 characters, including a lowercase English letter,” “uppercase English letter,” “digit,” and “symbol (something that is not a digit or an English letter) “Taken together, the letters must not form a word in our dictionary.”|data3|
|_basic12_|at least 12 characters | 12 |
|_basic16_|at least 16 characters | 16 |
|_basic20_|at least 20 characters | 20 |
|_3class12_|at least 12 characters at least 3 of the four character classes |12|
|_3class16_|at least 16 characters at least three of the four character classes |16|
|_2word12_|at least 12 characters and two words (letter sequences separated by a nonletter sequence)|12|
|_2word16_|at least 16 characters and two words (letter sequences separated by a nonletter sequence)|16|
|_2list12_|Participants in 2list12 saw an explicit list of blacklisted substrings, and those in 2s-list12 were simply told “Do not include words commonly found in passwords (e.g. password), keyboard patterns (e.g., qazx), or other common patterns (e.g. 5678).” We used the following blacklist.|12|
|_2s-list12_|Participants in 2list12 saw an explicit list of blacklisted substrings, and those in 2s-list12 were simply told “Do not include words commonly found in passwords (e.g. password), keyboard patterns (e.g., qazx), or other common patterns (e.g. 5678).” We used the following blacklist.|12|
|_2pattern12_|This combined 2class12 with the pattern requirement, that the pass- word start and end with a lowercase letter. We hoped that this would lead to a more even distribution of special characters within passwords, making passwords more difficult to guess.|12|
|_2list-patt12_|These conditions combined the blacklist and pattern requirements.|12|
|_2s-list-patt12_|These conditions combined the blacklist and pattern requirements.|12|
