## Character Classes 
- Uppercase Letters
- Lowercase Letters
- Digits
- Symbols


## Special comp8
- ***Symbol:*** something that is not a digit or an English letter
- Taken together, the letters must not form a word in our dictionary


## Blacklist Warning
From [Shay et al.'s](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2891411) work:

- Participants in _2s-list12_ were told ***“Do not include words commonly found in passwords (e.g. password), keyboard patterns (e.g., qazx), or other common patterns (e.g. 5678).”***
## Blacklist

From [Shay et al.'s](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2891411) work:

- Participants in _2list12_ saw an explicit list of blacklisted substrings:
    - _123!_, _amazon_, _character_, _monkey_, _number_, _survey_, _this_, _turk_ 
    - Any year between 1950 and 2049
    - The same character four or more times in a row
    - Any four consecutive characters from password
    - Any four sequential digits (e.g., 5678)
    - Any four sequential letters in the alphabet (e.g., wxyz)
    - Any four consecutive characters on the keyboard (e.g., wsxc)

## Pattern

- The password should start and end with a _lowercase_ letter.
