# Slider

A custom styled range (aka slider) input `input[type=range]` to allow users to choose a numeric
value by manipulating a thumb along a track with a defined min and max values via mouse or
left/right arrows . It includes an accompanying number field for keyboard input or up/down arrows.

## Note

Because Storybook isn't currently set up to handle Tailwind's PostCSS processing the styling is not
currently fully conformant to our theme/designs.
