# AnonLayout Component

The Auth-owned AnonLayoutComponent is to be used for unauthenticated pages, where we don't know who
the user is (this includes viewing a Send).

The AnonLayoutComponent is not to be implemented by every component that uses it in the component's
template directly. Instead the AnonLayoutComponent is implemented via routable composition, which
gives us the advantages of nested routes in Angular.

To allow for routable composition, Web has an AnonLayoutWrapperComponent which embeds the Auth-owned
AnonLayoutComponent.

For clarity:

- AnonLayoutComponent = Auth-owned library component - `<auth-anon-layout>`
- AnonLayoutWrapperComponent = Web component -
  `apps/web/src/app/auth/anon-layout-wrapper.component.ts`

The AnonLayoutWrapperComponent (Web) embeds the AnonLayoutComponent (Auth-owned) along with the
router outlets:

```html
<!-- File: anon-layout-wrapper.component.html (Web component)-->

<auth-anon-layout>
  <router-outlet></router-outlet>
  <router-outlet slot="secondary" name="secondary"></router-outlet>
</auth-anon-layout>
```

To implement, the developer should not even need to work with the AnonLayoutComponent (Auth-owned)
directly. The devoloper simply uses the AnonLayoutWrapperComponent (Web) in `oss-routing.module.ts`
to construct the page via routable composition:

```javascript
{
    path: "",
    component: AnonLayoutWrapperComponent, // Web component (not the Auth-owned component)
    children: [
      {
        path: "sample-route", // replace with your route
        component: MyPrimaryComponent, // replace with your component
      },
      {
        path: "",
        component: MySecondaryComponent, // replace with your component (or remove this secondary outlet object entirely if not needed)
        outlet: "secondary",
      },
    ],
  },
```
