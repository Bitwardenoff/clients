# Section Header

The `<bit-section-header>` component is meant to be used in combination with the `<bit-section>` and
`<bit-card>` components.

When placed inside of a section with a card as the immediate next sibling, the section header will
automatically apply bottom padding.

```html
<bit-section>
  <bit-section-header>
    <h2 bitTypography="h6" noMargin slot="title">I'm a section header</h2>
    <button bitIconButton="bwi-star" size="small" slot="end"></button>
  </bit-section-header>
  <bit-card>
    <h3 bitTypography="h3">I'm card content</h3>
  </bit-card>
</bit-section>
```

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.InSectionWithCard} />
</Canvas>

If placed inside of a section without a card, or with a card that is not the immediate next sibling,
the bottom padding is not applied.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.InSectionWithoutPadding} />
</Canvas>

## Content Slots

`bit-section-header` contains the following slots to help position the content:

| Slot                  | Description                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `slot="title"`        | title text of the header        |
| `slot="title-suffix"` | placed after the title          |
| `slot="end"`          | placed at the end of the header |

### Title slot

The title should be a `bitTypography` element, usually an `h2` styled as an `h6`. Title text will
automatically have its bottom margin removed and the `headers` color applied.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.OnlyTitle} />
</Canvas>

### Title suffix slot

Title suffixes are typically an icon or icon button.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.TitleSuffix} />
</Canvas>

### End slot

The end slot will typically be used for text or an icon button.

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.TrailingText} />
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
  <Story of={stories.TrailingIcon} />
</Canvas>
