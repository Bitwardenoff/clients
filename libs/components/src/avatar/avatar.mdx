# Avatar

Avatars display a unique color that helps a user visually recognize their logged in account.

A variance in color across the avatar component is important as it is used in Account Switching as a
visual indicator to recognize which of a personal or work account a user is logged into.

## Size

### Large: 64px

<Story of of={stories.Large} />

### Default: 48px

<Story of of={stories.Default} />

### Small 28px

<Story of of={stories.Small} />

## Styles:

`textColor:` set dynamically based on background color to maintain a 4.5:1 contrast ratio.

`backgroundColor:` defined by control, see next section

`fontSize: 20px` since tailwind classes don’t render in the image function use 20px for the default
size. Font-size will scale automatically from this.

`fontWeight: 400`

`charCount: 2`

## Background color

The Background color can be manually set. However, typically the avatar color should be defined by
the user's `Name` field.

<Story of of={stories.ColorByText} />
Use the user 'ID' field if `Name` is not defined.
<Story of of={stories.ColorByID} />

## Outline

If the avatar is displayed on one of the theme's `background` color variables or is interactive,
display the avatar with a 1 pixel `secondary-500` border to meet WCAG AA graphic contrast guidelines
for interactive elements.

<Story of of={stories.Border} />

## Avatar as a button

The Avatar can be used as a button.

Typically this is only in the navigation on client apps where account switching is used and in the
web app for the account menu indicator.

When the avatar is used as a button, the following states should be used:

`TODO: add stories for button avatars. See Figma`

## Accessibility

Avatar background color should have 3.1:1 contrast with it’s background; or include the
`secondary-500` border Avatar text should have 4.5:1 contrast with the avatar background color
