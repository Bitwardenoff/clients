# Simple Dialogs

Simple Dialogs are used throughout the app for simple alert or confirmation actions such as
speedbumps.

For dialogs with a high number of interactive elements such as a form or content exceeding 384px,
use the [Dialog component](?path=/docs/component-library-dialogs-dialog--docs).

<Primary />
<Controls />

## Placement

Like Dialogs, Simple Dialogs should be centered vertically and horizontally on screen and their
height should expand to fit their content until there are 2rems of margin on the top/bottom of the
dialog. In this case, the simple dialog should become scrollable.

A background scrim should be used to hide the content below the dialog. Use `#000000` with
`30% opacity`. See
[Dialog Service](?path=/story/component-library-dialogs-service-simpleconfigurable--default)

## Scrolling Content

<Story of={stories.ScrollingContent} />

## Accessibility

The triggering button should indicate to assistive technology that additional content will open or
appear when the trigger is selected. Consider using `aria-haspopup="true"`

Dialog should include `role=“dialog”`

The Dialog title should be in an `<h1>`

Dialog title should be announced by a screen reader when launched. Consider using `aria-labledby` or
`aria-label`

When opened, focus should follow the visual order of the popover’s focusable content. Typically
focus is moved to the close button, but it is acceptable to move focus to the first interactive
element after close since a user may not want to close the dialog immediately if there are
additional interactive elements. See
[WCAG Focus Order success criteria](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/focus-order.html)

A user should not be able to tab focus outside of the Dialog until it has been closed.

Once closed, focus should remain on the the element which triggered the Dialog.

Clicking outside the dialog or clicking escape should close the dialog (this prevents a keyboard
trap)

**Note:** If a Simple Dialog is triggered from a main Dialog, be sure to make sure focus is moved to
the Simple Dialog.
