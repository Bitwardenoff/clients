# Badge

The Badge directive can be used on a `<span>` (non clickable events), or an `<a>` or `<button>` tag for interactive events. The focus and Hhver states only apply to badges used for interactive events.

Bitwarden typically only uses badges with text set to tailwind `text-xs` with a `bold` weight. If additional sizes are needed, Desing and the component library working group can review and adjust the component configurations.
